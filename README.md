# Line-Follower-Robot
This is a simulation of a Line-Follower Robot done in Proteus. It uses ATmega32 as its microcontroller.It uses 3 IR sensors which provides input to the microcontroller. After appropriate calculations, the values for the speed and direction control of the robot is given out to the L2983 Motor driver in order to drive the two motors(wheels) of the robot in appropriate direction.

Be more careful of the braces while writing if-else conditions and while loops. It has a convention to put braces in a way which is a little different that of the one in C lanuage.
