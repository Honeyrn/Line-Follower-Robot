# Line Follower Robot Simulation in Proteus
Welcome to the Line-Follower Robot Simulation repository! This project is a simulation of a Line-Follower Robot implemented in Proteus, utilizing the ATmega32 microcontroller. The robot incorporates three IR sensors to provide input to the microcontroller. After performing the necessary calculations, the microcontroller outputs values for speed and direction control to the L2983 Motor driver, steering the robot's two motors (wheels) appropriately.

# Overview
This simulation serves as a practical exploration of a Line-Follower Robot, a common and essential concept in robotics. The ATmega32 microcontroller, in conjunction with IR sensors and a motor driver, showcases the integration of hardware components for precise control and navigation based on input from the environment.

# Features
## Microcontroller: 
The ATmega32 microcontroller, serving as the central processing unit of the robot, undertakes the intricate task of processing input from the three IR sensors. This intelligent microcontroller is responsible for making real-time decisions based on sensor data and generating precise control signals for the motors.

## IR Sensors:
Equipped with three Infrared (IR) sensors strategically placed, the robot gathers essential data for its navigation. These sensors act as the robot's eyes, continuously scanning the surface beneath to detect and interpret the line it's meant to follow. The synergy between the microcontroller and IR sensors enables the robot to make swift and accurate decisions to stay on the designated path.

## Motor Control:
The L2983 Motor driver plays a pivotal role in executing the commands generated by the microcontroller. This sophisticated motor driver interprets the signals received, translating them into precise instructions for the motors. The robot's ability to achieve the desired speed and direction is a testament to the efficiency of the motor control system, ensuring navigation along the predefined line.
